## Part 1

Create a model to represent items for sales on the Cheese Counter, ie types of Cheese. Add this model to the Admin screens, and customise.

## Part 1.5

Add the missing _slug_ field into the Cheese model to allow for better URLs when the data is retrieved. Create migration, rebuild database, reload revised text fixture.

URLs for individual cheese pages should now be:

    /cheese_counter/name-of-cheese
