## Part 1

Create a model to represent items for sale on the Cheese Counter, ie types of Cheese. Add
this model to the Admin screens, and customise.

## Part 1.5

Add the missing _slug_ field into the Cheese model to allow for better URLs when the
data is retrieved. Create Migration, rebuild database, reload revised test fixture.

URLs for individual cheese pages should now be:

    /cheese_counter/name-of-cheese
